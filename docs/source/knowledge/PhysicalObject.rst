What is a thing? ---- Heidegger, M.: What is a Thing? Regenery/Gateway, Indiana (1967)

    A thing is always something that has such and such properties, 
    always something that is constituted in such and such a way. 
    This something is the bearer of the properties; the something, as it were, that underlies the qualities.
